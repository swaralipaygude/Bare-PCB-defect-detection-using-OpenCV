# Bare-PCB-defect-detection-using-OpenCV

This project implements the detection of bare PCB defects such as missing hole, mouse bite and open circuit, using the OpenCV library in Python. 
<br> The image processing technique called Image Subtraction is used for the purpose of defect detection.

The Bare-PCB-images-dataset folder contains the dataset used for this project. It contains RGB images of five types of bare PCBs. It includes the non-defective and defective PCB images.
