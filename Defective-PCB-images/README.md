Defective-PCB-images folder consists of three sub-folders which contain images for three different defects, namely Missing hole, Mouse bite, Open circuit.

Each folder has the defective images for the five PCB types in the [Template-PCB-images](https://github.com/swaralipaygude/Bare-PCB-defect-detection-using-OpenCV/tree/main/Template-PCB-images) folder, ie, PCBs 01, 05, 07, 10, 11.

For each of these, the original defective images(normal orientation) have been rotated in 3 ways; left, right and 180 degrees(mirror image of original).

All the images are sorted into the folders accordingly.

Thus, the number of defective images is as follows:
<br>Missing hole -> 55 (original) * 4 (rotations) = 220
<br>Mouse bite -> 55 (original) * 4 (rotations) = 220
<br>Open circuit -> 56 (original) * 4 (rotations) = 224

Thus, the total number of defective images is 664.
