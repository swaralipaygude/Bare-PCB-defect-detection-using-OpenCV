Defective-PCB-images folder consists of three sub-folders which contain images for three different defects, namely Missing hole, Mouse bite, Open circuit.
Each folder has the defective images for the five PCB types in the [Template-PCB-images](https://github.com/swaralipaygude/Bare-PCB-defect-detection-using-OpenCV/tree/main/Template-PCB-images) folder, ie, PCBs 01, 05, 07, 10, 11.
For each of these, the original defective images(normal orientation) have been rotated in 3 ways; left, right and 180 degrees(mirror image of original).
All the images are sorted into the folders accordingly.
